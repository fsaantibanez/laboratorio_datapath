## **Trabajo en equipo**

Buenas noches esta  es nuestra tarea de GitHub en equipo

Software development is all about writing code and developing solutions following requirements and processes. Managing code becomes complex with time and multiple contributors. In the real scenario, multiple developers work on the same project and write code on a daily basis. Tracking changes and merging those codes are hassle and time-consuming without any proper tools or platforms. Another issue is rollback which is not possible without using any version control tools. When it comes to writing code, source code management is another important factor to consider. Source code management is not only just storing the code safely but also tracking the changes, resolving the conflicts, and merging from multiple contributors
